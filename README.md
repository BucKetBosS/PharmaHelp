# PharmaHelp

PharmaHelp is an android application which helps you locate the nearest pharmacy based on a particular chosen medicine.
It finds the current location of the the user, and based on the medicine chosen by the user, it locates the nearest pharmacy to 
the user. It also suggests alternative medicines for the same cure, if the chosen medicine is not available. The optimal pharmacy for 
a particular medicine is chosen based on the rate, demographical location and quantity.
